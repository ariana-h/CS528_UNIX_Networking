# CS 528: UNIX Programming
**Authors:** Ariana Huhko and John Pertell

## Overview
This repository contains various network programming projects for CS 528: Unix Programming. Some projects have been extensively tested using the CORE framework. Check out the project [HERE](https://github.com/coreemu/core).

## Projects

### 1. Morse Code UDP Client-Server
- **Description**: Implements a UDP-based client-server system that translates plaintext messages into Morse code. The server receives text, converts it to Morse, and sends it back. The client can optionally decode the Morse response.
- **Key Features**:
  - UDP-based communication
  - Morse code encoding and decoding
  - Packet drop handling
- **Usage**:
  - Run the server: `./server <SERVER_IP>`
  - Run the client: `./client <SERVER_IP> [-d]`
  - Type `exit` to terminate the client.
