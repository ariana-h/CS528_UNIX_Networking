# LlamaFeed

## Abstract

LlamaFeed is a software solution that aims to combat internet “trolls” on social media. It is a very well-known fact that social media is full of offensive and misinformation. This is a problem that could be easily solved using Artificial Intelligence. LlamaFeed combats this by using Ollama Large Language Models in conjunction with social media to classify and develop early warnings on posts. Llama models will be used as a truth indicator to warn against misinformation and a flag warning for offensive comments. LlamaFeed clears feeds every 24 hours. Before clearing posts, the Ollama node will summarize the day’s conversation and upload them to a central viewing page where all users (including guests) can access.
